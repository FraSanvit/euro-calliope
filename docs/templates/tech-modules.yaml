    exclusive-energy-to-power-ratios: |
        Constrain the energy to power ratios of battery and hydrogen storage in a way that they do not overlap (in Calliope terms, energy="storage capacity", power="energy capacity").
        Battery storage is constrained to a ratio of ≤4h while hydrogen is constrained to a ratio of ≥4h.
        The ratio is derived from typical values of commercial lithium-ion batteries available today (2021).
        Constraining hydrogen storage as well ensures it does not directly compete with battery storage, but is used instead for durations of fours hours and longer.

  techs:
    battery: Battery storage
    hydrogen: Hydrogen power storage
storage/hydro.yaml:
  overrides:
    no-hydro-storage-fixed-cost: Set installation costs of pumped hydro storage to zero.

supply/load-shedding.yaml:
  overrides:
    load-shedding: |
        Add an option to shed load at each location.
        You can use this to model blackouts, brownouts, or controlled shedding of load as a form of demand response.
        In Euro-Calliope, we model load shedding not as actual reduction of demand but as an unconstrained supply of electricity.
        This supply has high variable cost (see the load-shedding.yaml module) and no fixed cost.
        Due to its high cost, it will only be used when no other, less costly, option is available.

    load_shedding: Load shedding as last resort

    directional-rooftop-pv: |
        By default, Euro-Calliope contains a single technology for rooftop PV.
        This technology comprises the total rooftop PV potential in each location, in particular including east-, west-, and north-facing rooftops.
        While this allows you the model fully exploit the potential of rooftop PV, it leads to less than optimal capacity factors as long as the potential is not fully exploited.
        That is because in reality, one would likely first exploit all south-facing rooftops, then east- and west-facing rooftops, and only then -- if at all -- north-facing rooftops.
        When using this override, there are three technologies instead of just one for rooftop PV.
        The three technologies comprise (1) south-facing PV (on either south-facing or flat rooftops), (2) east- and west-facing PV, and (3) north-facing PV.
        This leads to higher capacity factors of rooftop PV as long as the potential of rooftop PV is not fully exploited.
        However, this also increases the complexity of the model.
